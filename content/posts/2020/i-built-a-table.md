title: I built a table üí™
description: I‚Äôve never really done much woodwork, but my wife decided she wanted me to repurpose some sixty-plus-year-old barn wood. I‚Äôm always up for a challenge, so I figured what better way to do justice to it than to go down the rabbit hole of fine-furniture creation, and about a hundred hours later, I finished building our dining room table!

    <p>My wife and I were lucky to acquire some beautiful old wood from a demolished barn in the family. We needed a proper dining room table, so my wife asked if I could build one and, without realising the scale of the undertaking, I said "hell yuh!" Around a hundred hours and a lot of sweat later, I produced a table and bench combo!</p>
    <p>With no fine-furniture experience, not much woodworking experience either, imperial measuring tapes, and hours of trial and error, I finally built some furniture I'm proud of! Here's to many years of use üçª</p>

            <p>I first started by planing the pieces outside to remove the really rough/sharp pieces to make the pieces more workable. I started with the lowest plane setting as to not take off too much patina.</p>

            <p>Some piece had nails, some did but were the best fit. I sorted to make them fit the best I could, shortened certain pieces, then cut the ends of at 45&deg;.</p>
            <p>After having cut the ends, I was able to make the chevron pattern pretty easy on the floor to get a rough idea on dimensions.</p>

            <p>After a lot of back and forth, I decided to use 2x4s for the frame, joining the outer pieces together in 45&deg; with 5 pieces strategically placed at different distances to account for the off-center chevron pattern.</p>

            <p>With the frame assembled and two sides attached, I then moved on to assembling the chevron patter on the frame. Each piece of wood was different length, width, depth, so I strategically placed equal-ish sized planks together on both parts of the chevron.</p>

            <p>With the top pieces cut and placed, I moved on to securing them. Some pieces although formed a perfect 90&deg; angle, the pieces were uneven/wonky, and when flattened/ing, would skew the perfect 90&deg; angle, to overcome this, I cut and shimmed pieces of wood to make chevron pieces equal(er) & flat(ter). With movement in mind, I used figure-8 fasteners to attach the top pieces to the frame to allow to breathe.</p>

  <li>Plan, Plan, Plan! More MTCO (Measure Thrice, Cut Once), less YOLO (You Only Leveled Once).</li>
  <li>Have a clear workspace! I wish I had clear/ned my garage out completely sooner.</li>
  <li>Check the weather! Rain/Wind + sawdust isn't fun.</li>
