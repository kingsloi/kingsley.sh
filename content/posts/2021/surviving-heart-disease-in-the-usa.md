title: Surviving a Rare Gene Disorder & Heart Disease in the USA
description: I’m originally from a country where socialised medicine is the norm (the UK), so the idea of paying for healthcare directly out of my own pocket still feels very weird to me. Follow me on my journey as a parent to a child born with a rare congenital disorder and heart defect in the USA, and learn the staggering true cost of treating both in the USA along the way.

  <p>Having spent the first twenty-five years of my life in the United Kingdom, I had a lot of exposure to the country’s National Health Service (NHS). I had a bad childhood stutter requiring years of therapy, I had severe childhood asthma, my mom was suddenly hospitalised and died when I was a teen, I broke bones, was treated for infections/wounds, wore braces for eight+ years, had my jaw bones broken, shortened, and fixed together with eight pins (bimaxillary osteotomy), had two kidney stone surgeries, countless X-rays, CTs, MRIs, etc. My dad got treated for, and is in remission from, cancer ... you get the point, and thanks to socialised medicine, my family and I never received a bill or invoice.[1]</p>
  <h2>BITTERSWEET NEWS:</h2>
  <p>In 2016, while on a trip to the USA, I met my (now) wife, and we've lived together in the beautiful city of Gary, Indiana, ever since. Fast-forward a few years to 2020, and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, my wife and I found out we were expecting our first child. At our 20-week anatomy scan (performed at 21 weeks), my wife was sent for further testing at UChicago in Illinois, and we discovered the devastating news that our baby had half a heart, a condition considered to be incompatible with life outside the womb. </p>

  <p>After a week of further tests, scans, and echos, we received the final diagnosis of a rare variant of a congenital heart disease called hypoplastic left heart syndrome, or HLHS for short. 1 out of every 3,800 babies born in the United States each year is born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.[2] Her rare variant occurs roughly once in 25,000 births.</p>
  <p>An amniocentesis ruled out Down's syndrome, Trisomy 13, 18, and a few other genetic abnormalities. The hospital moved quickly with our appointments for the further testing, we later discovered this was because Illinois bans terminating a pregnancy after fetal viability (generally considered to be 24 weeks gestation), Indiana is two weeks sooner, at 22 weeks. We received the results from the amniocentesis and further tests a few days before 24 weeks.</p>
  <p>My wife and I agreed that our child’s quality of life, and their ability to feel love and happiness is all that really mattered to us. We didn’t care if our child wasn’t the smartest, or an athlete, we just wanted them to be loved, happy, and kind. My wife joined a HLHS Facebook group, asked some tough questions, and seeing the perspective from other parents of children with HLHS helped ease our minds that our child, with life-saving intervention, surgeries, and therapy, could, and should live a happy, healthy, fulfilled life, at least until adulthood.</p>
  <h2>ONE IN 700 MILLION</h2>
  <p>Sterling, our daughter, was born in early September 2020 at 39 weeks to the soothing sounds of Lacksley Castell's “Speak Softly.” She needed a life-saving procedure minutes after birth to open a restrictive valve in her heart, had her first major open-heart surgery at seven days old (Norwood), and at 5 months had her second major heart surgery (Glenn). She will require another major heart surgery by the time she's a toddler (Fontan). At 8 weeks old, Sterling was preemptively diagnosed with isomerism/heterotaxy syndrome, and at 3 months old, we got the ultimate diagnosis of a very rare genetic disorder called Kabuki Syndrome - only 1 out of every 33,200 babies worldwide are born with Kabuki syndrome.[3] According to her doctor, the odds of her heart condition and genetic condition occurring simultaneously are somewhere in the region of 1 in 700,000,000+, factor in her other diagnoses, and that number is around 1 in 2,000,000,000+.</p>

  <p>Sterling is a very special little lady, and her mom and I couldn't be more proud of our beautiful little fighter, Shakespeare's “And though she be but little, she is fierce” is her motto. All things considered, Sterling is doing extremely well, she will likely spend the first few months of her life in the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Advocate Children's Hospital in Oak Lawn, Chicago, Illinois, under the care of some truly wonderful and world class nurses, doctors, and surgeons.</p>

  <h2>THE HARSH REALITY OF PAID HEALTHCARE:</h2>
  <p>The idea of paying for healthcare is still extremely foreign to me. In spite of the numerous occasions on which I and my parents had cause to call on the UK NHS, money was never mentioned. We were never at risk of medical debt bankruptcy, affordability was never even a question; the treatment was just there when we needed it. Now, I live in a country that charges $40 for skin-to-skin contact after birth, where the plot of Breaking Bad is centered around an ordinary guy creating a meth empire to fund medical expenses related to cancer treatment, where people ration insulin, partake in medical tourism, and unnecessarily suffer with treatable ailments because they are either uninsured, underinsured, or simple can't afford the doctor's visit.</p>

  <p>My daughter’s diagnosis is hard enough as it is, but it just adds salt to our wounds knowing that there's a cost associated with literally every milliliter of medicine, every treatment, every day in the PCICU, every scan, every test, every future doctor’s visit, every ER/A&E visit, every future surgery.

  <p>There is no guarantee of her future insurability, or of my ability to pay her increased insurance premiums due to her preexisting conditions. Bankruptcy, and losing our home, are very real possibilities. These are the terrifying thoughts that the system is forcing us to confront at a time when our focus should be on our daughter.</p>

  <h2>COUNTING MY BLESSINGS:</h2>
  <p>But ... I am lucky. I have a wonderful wife, a happy, healthy marriage, a great boss, a great job, with great benefits, and a great profession that allows me great freedom. And thanks to the generosity of family, friends, and strangers donating to our GoFundMe campaign, we’ll likely make ends meet. However, paying for my sick child’s medical bills with other people's generous donations is a hard pill to swallow. I pay over $700 per month for the best insurance policy my work benefits offer, and I’ve reduced my deductible and out-of-pocket maximum to their lowest levels, but it still isn’t even close to enough; I tried to avoid a GoFundMe for as long as I could, but the brutal reality is that we simply couldn’t survive and support Sterling right now without it. And that’s just wrong.</p>

  <h2>PICTURE THIS:</h2>
  <p>Imagine for a moment that your child is desperately sick. You've been in the hospital at their bedside for weeks, only leaving to sleep at the local Ronald McDonald House. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, you're not allowed to enter the city of the hospital if you come from a COVID-19 hot spot without a fourteen-day self-quarantine, and your home in Indiana is considered to be a hotspot. Now imagine, unbeknown to you, that hospital bills start to arrive in the mail at your home, a steady trickle of demands for amounts like $16, $200, and $250. You finally realise you have overdue bills, so you call to pay them, only to find out your non-payment has already landed you in pre-collections, and that you were just days away from it being sent to collections.</p>

  <p>This was my reality. A mark on my credit history for a few hundred dollars, only eight weeks into my daughter’s lifelong condition. And a wake-up call that no matter how sensitive and caring and kind the medical staff, when it comes to money the system simply doesn’t care.</p>

  <h2>PICTURE THIS #2:</h2>
  <p>You're at home now, you get a phone call from the hospital saying you owe a $12,000 doctor's bill and to either pay now or set up a payment plan. Your deductible is $400, and your family max out of pocket is $4,400 per year, so owing $12,000 came as a surprise. You used your insurance’s online portal hoping to find some answers, there you find the $12,000 doctor's bill but you also discover that your daughter’s entire 147 day hospital stay was denied by your insurance, and that you owe $2,574,135.43. Due to not having pre-approval for your daughter’s stay, even though both the hospital and insurance knew of your daughter 4 months prior to her arrival. This again, was my reality. It would take me 25 years of paying my entire gross salary to pay that off. I’m hoping it’s a mistake.</p>

      "Don't worry, this isn't a bill" oh ok &hellip; but it is "what you pay", so kinda like a bill?

  <p>Being the data-nerd I am, I want to share this journey, so I'm going to track all bills related to my daughter’s care, hopefully highlight the actual real-life cost of surviving a chronic disease in the USA, and further prove the system is just all kinds of wrong. Change can start with a single voice. I know I’m not alone in what I’m experiencing, and maybe, just maybe, together we can make some noise, and some good can come out of this nightmare of medical financial vampirism. If nothing else, I can hopefully be a light for others to find and know they are not alone.</p>

  <p>I'll keep this blog updated as/when I can. In the meantime, I’m going to hold tight to my daughter’s hand and tell her everything’s going to be alright. Because what other choice do I have?</p>
