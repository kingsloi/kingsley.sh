title: Surviving a Rare Gene Disorder & Heart Disease in the USA
description: Iâ€™m originally from a country where socialised medicine is the norm (the UK), so the idea of paying for healthcare directly out of my own pocket still feels very weird to me. Follow me on my journey as a parent to a child born with a rare congenital disorder and heart defect in the USA, and learn the staggering true cost of treating both in the USA along the way.
