    <h2>Baby/child (or patient, same things probably apply right?)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Read stories to your baby and record yourself reading them. Tell the nurses to play them back to your baby when you're not there. It was a real hit with our baby, and she loved hearing our voices. I recommend the Sony ICD-UX570 Digital Voice Recorder, it has a retractable built-in USB charger, the hospital thankfully had USB power sockets, so we charged it directly in the wall. Honestly, we read a lot of kids books, but don't be afraid to slip in a few rude or inappropriate ones. For instance, "Go the F**k to Sleep" by Adam Mansbach, and my personal favourite, the "Alfredo" Comic Book by Freddie "Half Manne, Half Cocaine" Gibbs and The Alchemist, everyone should know the power of 1000 [crack] fiends.</li>
        <li>Hospital provide clean/sterile clothes, so you're pretty much left with feed/hands/hair. Our lil baby had her <a href="https://www.bonfire.com/store/sterling-strong/">defining pig tails</a> since she was a few weeks old. She also had some UGG open toe slippers, and some crocheted Gucci flip flops, and various other shoes, bows, socks, mittens, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Health & wellbeing üôè</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lip balm, moisturizer, it's hella dry.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Food</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bring condiments, hospital food gets bland after awhile. It's amazing what some Frank's RedHot or some ranch can do to food.</li>
        <li>Buy Re-usable Cutlery. You will end up with an abundance of straws, and knives, but no forks or spoons. Decline straws, buy a reusable one, and/or a Yeti.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Comfy clothes/shoes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweat pants, stretch denim jeans, etc.</li>
        <li>Wear a different pair of shoes/slippers than the ones you arrive with.</li>
        <li>If you're ever chilly, 100% ask for a warm blanket, they are wonderful.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Kodak Luma 350 Portable Smart Projector</li>
        <li>If hospital wifi, or phone hotspot plan. My wife and I have 10GB each (20GB combined ~6hours @ 1080p or ~40hours @ 480p), wish we could buy more, but apparently ATT don't allow one-off data purchases.</li>
        <li>Skyroam Solis Lite Global 4G LTE Hotspot. We use this when we run out of hotspot data. It's expensive, so buy day passes when they have them on offer. Don't use <code>+</code> in your email (e.g. <code>first.last+label@gmail.com</code>).</li>
        <li>Get a small speaker for the projector.3w mini aux-in portable speaker. What's nice, it's small, plugs directly into 3.5mm audio output, and has a built-in 350mAh lithium battery that you can charge from the projector's USB.</li>
        <li>Google Chromecast, fits nicely in the projector's HDMI & USB.</li>
        <li>Extension Cord, phone chargers. Ideally, one that has built in USB ports so you can charge your phone without a USB block.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Planning, bills, appointments, events, life, etc.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Felt Board w/ letters</li>
        <li>USB Fairy Lights</li>
        <li>5 Year Planner</li>
    </ul>
