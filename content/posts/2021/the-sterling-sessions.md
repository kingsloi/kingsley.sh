  <p>My parents introduced me to a lot of reggae growing up, every Sunday, David Rodigan's BBC's session would echo throughout my house. Reggae is the music of healing!</p>
  <p class="mb-5">During my daughter's ICU stay at Advocate Christ, her wonderful music therapist remixed/parodied some of my favourite reggae songs, with lyrics that I remixed myself. Enjoy!<p>
  <h2>Speak Softly Sterling</h2>
  <p>Fun fact: my daughter was born to this song, and album!</p>

  <h2 class="pt-5 mt-5">You’ve Made Us So Very Happy</h2>
  <p>Fun fact: The beats in the song, our all 3 of my family's heart beat. The music therapist used an awesome stethoscope that had an mp3 recorder built into it and was able to record our heart beats, and used GarageBand to put it all together! <em>Bravo!</em> </p>
