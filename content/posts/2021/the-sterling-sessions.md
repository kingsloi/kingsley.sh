  <p>My parents introduced me to a lot of reggae growing up, every Sunday, David Rodigan's BBC's session would echo throughout my house. Reggae is the music of healing!</p>
  <p class="mb-5">During my daughter's ICU stay at Advocate Children's Hospital, her wonderful music therapist remixed/parodied some of my favourite reggae songs, with lyrics that I remixed myself. Enjoy!<p>
  <h2>Speak Softly Sterling</h2>
  <p>Fun fact: my daughter was born to this song, and album!</p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-5">
    <p class="mb-0">
      🎵 Speak Softly Sterling, so no-one hears you cry<br/>
      The kisses we give today, you cannot buy<br/>
      And all our lives we'll spend with you<br/>
      Mommy's and daddy's dream came true   🎵

  <h2 class="pt-5 mt-5">You’ve Made Us So Very Happy</h2>
  <p>Fun fact: The beats in the song are all of our heart beats. The music therapist used an awesome stethoscope that had an mp3 recorder built into it and was able to record our heart beats, and used GarageBand to put it all together! <em>Bravo!</em> </p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote text-center my-5">
    <p class="mb-0">
      🎵 Some days were really blue<br/>
      But when it came to loving you, now<br/>
      I'd spend my whole life with you, Sterl<br/>
      'Cos you came and you took control<br/>
      You touched my very soul 🎵
